"""Build the gallery through the command line, and keep what it wrote as golden files.

`docs/reference/cli.md` promises that the same input produces byte-identical output, and
that two runs on different machines produce files `cmp` calls equal. In-process tests
cannot see the second half: every output was CRLF on Windows until #89, and nothing
noticed. So `tests/test_golden.py` builds the gallery exactly as a user would, through
`scenet build`, and compares the **bytes on disk** with what is committed here, in every
CI job -- Linux on two Pythons, and Windows.

Two kinds of golden:

- `tests/golden/core/` holds every Panel Core and Page Core the gallery compiles to. Core
  is small, readable and diffable by design, so a change in layout is reviewed coordinate
  by coordinate.
- `tests/golden/digests.json` holds the SHA-256 of every SVG: each panel, its debug
  overlay, its live-text variant, each strip and each page. SVG is too large to review
  usefully as text, and its Core already says what moved.

After an intended change to the output, regenerate and review the diff:

    uv run python scripts/update_golden.py           # rewrite the goldens
    uv run python scripts/update_golden.py --check   # exit 1 if any is stale
