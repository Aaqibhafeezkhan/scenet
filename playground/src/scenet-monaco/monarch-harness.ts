/**
 * Run the comic-script Monarch tokenizer in Node, with Monaco's own lexer.
 *
 * A test that reimplemented Monarch would test the reimplementation. These are the modules
 * the editor runs, given the three services the lexer asks for as stubs: none of them can
 * change a token's type, which is all the tests look at. See `monaco-internals.d.ts` for
 * why importing them is acceptable.
 *
 * Monaco catches an exception the tokenizer throws and leaves the line uncoloured, logging
 * nothing a user sees. Here it propagates, which is the point.
