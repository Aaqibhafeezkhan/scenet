"""An MCP server, so a model can check and render the panels it writes.

The spec pack tells a model what the language is; this lets it find out what it got
wrong. A model writes a document, calls `validate`, reads findings that each name a
rule, a line and a fix, corrects its own output and calls `render` -- with no human
copying error text between a terminal and a chat window. It is the only part of the
agent-facing surface that closes that loop.

Install it with the extra, and start it with the `scenet mcp` command:

    pip install 'scenet[mcp]'
    scenet mcp                             # stdio, for a local client
    scenet mcp --transport streamable-http # for a remote one

## The official SDK, and only as an extra

Built on the official [`mcp`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
package, which already speaks protocol revision 2026-07-28 -- the stateless core, the
extensions framework, cacheable list results -- and adds nothing FastMCP would have to
supply. It is an extra rather than a dependency because it brings an HTTP stack the
compiler has no use for: the browser playground installs the base wheel into Pyodide,
and someone who only wants `scenet build` should not have to put Starlette through
their own licence review.

Transports are stdio and Streamable HTTP. Not SSE: the protocol has deprecated it, and
Streamable HTTP replaced it.

## Five tools, shaped after compilers that are already served this way

[typst-mcp](https://github.com/johannesbrandenburger/typst-mcp) serves its
documentation one chapter at a time, checks a snippet, and renders one;
[d2-mcp](https://github.com/h0rv/d2-mcp) has a cheat sheet, `compile` to validate and
`render` to draw. The same shapes, rather than new ones:

- `get_spec` -- the spec pack, one part at a time, so a model need not read all of it
- `list_puppets` -- the characters it may cast, with their poses and expressions
- `validate` -- every finding at once, shaped rather than dumped as raw SARIF
- `compile` -- the Panel Core: where the compiler put everything, and why
- `render` -- the SVG, byte-identical to what `scenet build --embed-images` writes

Each takes the document as **text**, not a path. A remote client shares no file
system with the server, and one calling convention for both transports is one less
thing to get wrong. Every tool is read-only and closed-world, and says so in its
annotations: nothing here writes a file or reaches the network.

A document that names a file -- a picture behind the cast, a lettering face -- is sent
with it: `files` maps the path the document writes to the file's bytes, in base64. They
stand in for the document's folder and are read in memory; the server never reads a
folder of its own, and never writes one.

## Keeping stdout clean

On stdio, stdout *is* the protocol stream, and one stray line corrupts it. That is why
nothing here goes through `cli.run_build`, which prints `wrote` and `note:` lines --
the easiest way there is to ship a broken stdio server. Notes travel in the tool
result instead. The SDK also points file descriptor 1 at stderr while it serves, which
catches a stray `print` from a dependency; the test suite drives a real stdio session
against the installed command to make sure neither ever matters.
