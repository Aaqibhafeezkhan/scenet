"""Placing everything in a panel that carries words: balloons, captions, and tails.

Placement is a scored search over candidate positions rather than a sweep of a cost
grid. Balloons belong in a small number of sensible places relative to their speaker
-- around the head, or tucked into a corner -- so generating those directly is both
cheaper than scanning cells and produces more natural results. This is the approach
used in the cartographic label-placement literature, which is the same problem.

The constraint that naive implementations miss is **reading order**. A box may never
sit above-and-left of the one before it in the script, because that makes the panel
read in the wrong order. That is a correctness bug in a comic, not a cosmetic one, so
it is enforced as a hard filter rather than scored.

Captions go through this machinery rather than a parallel one. The placement
principles the lettering references give for floating text -- keep off the important
figures, preserve the space of the art, keep the reading order flowing -- are the ones
already implemented here. What differs is where a caption *wants* to be: a balloon
mildly dislikes hugging the panel edge, and a caption is looking for exactly that.

So the two are placed in **one pass in script order**, sharing the list of boxes
already down. Placing every caption first would be simpler and wrong: a caption
written after the dialogue would then impose reading order on balloons that precede
it.

    than a compromise.

    One pass over the whole script, not captions and then balloons. The two share the
    list of boxes already placed, so a caption written between two lines of dialogue
    is read between them.

    Args:
        events: The panel's script, in reading order.
        actors: Resolved puppets, keyed by actor id.
        panel: The rectangle to compose within, margins already applied.
        metrics: Font to measure roman lettering against, in place of the family's.
        italic_metrics: Font to measure italic captions against, in place of the
            family's.
        typeface: The lettering family, emphasis face included. Defaults to the shipped
            one; `metrics` and `italic_metrics` replace single faces of it.
        font_size: Override for every type size, dialogue and captions alike, in panel
            units. For tests that want one size throughout.
        type_size: The dialogue size the author set with `lettering.size`, in panel
            units. Captions keep their proportion to it. Takes the place of
            `lettering_height`, which only matters when no size was set.
        lettering_height: The height type sizes are a fraction of, in place of the
            frame's own. A page passes one value to every panel on it, so a short panel
            and a tall one letter alike.
        backdrop: The resolved setting, if the panel has one. Its masses are a soft
            cost, never an exclusion: a balloon over a sky is the ordinary case.
        emanata: Actor id to the zones of the marks drawn around them. Also a soft
            cost, and a heavier one than a body, but never an exclusion.
        exclusions: Areas that are drawn over, such as an inset: as hard as a face, since
            words under them could not be read. They take no part in reading order.
        inside: The shape every box must lie within, when the panel is not a rectangle,
            margins already applied -- as `panel` has them. A box must also lie within
            `panel`; candidates are still generated in it.
        bounds: The panel's own rectangle, margins not applied: the frame an off-panel
            speaker's tail ends on. Defaults to `panel`.
        outline: The panel's own outline when it is not a rectangle, margins not
            applied, which that tail ends on instead.
