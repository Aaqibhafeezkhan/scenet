"""Page layout: tiers of panels, or of columns of panels, into frames.

Plain arithmetic, with no constraint solver. Tiers are ordered top to bottom and panels
left to right within a tier, and each takes a share of what the margins and gutters leave,
in proportion to its weight -- the same model as CSS Grid's `fr` tracks with a `gap`. A tier
of columns is split the same way twice: across into columns, then down each column into its
panels, with the tier gutter between them. There is nothing to choose between, so nothing
for Cassowary to do: its value in this project is the priority system that settles
conflicting preferences (`docs/explanation/prior_art.md`), and a strict grid has none.

The order panels are written in is the order they are read in. In a tier of panels that is
the Z-path. In a tier of columns it is down each column before across, which is what readers
do when a panel spanning the tier blocks the way across (Cohn, *Navigating Comics*, 2013);
:class:`PageLayout <scenet.ir.PageLayout>` refuses columns where nothing blocks it. An
inset is where readers agree least, splitting about evenly between it and the panel it
sits in, so it is read after its parent unless it says otherwise.

**Read right to left** (#68), as manga are, a tier's first panel or column is at the right.
The tier is laid out by the same arithmetic over its panels in the other order, so each
frame is exactly the one a left-to-right page gives that panel with the tier written the
other way round. Nothing is mirrored: a slanted gutter leans the way its `slant` says, an
inset sits in the corner its `at` names, and a column is still read top to bottom. An end
panel stays an end panel and keeps its width, so a layout one direction refuses, the other
refuses too.
