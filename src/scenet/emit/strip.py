"""Several panels laid out as a strip.

Deliberately minimal. Real page composition -- tiers, panels of varying size, the
page-level reading path, bleeds -- is a substantial design problem in its own right
and is explicitly out of scope. This is the smallest thing that lets a sequence be
read as a sequence: panels in a row, separated by a gutter, in declaration order.

The gutter is not decoration. It is where the reader performs what Scott McCloud calls
closure -- inferring what happened between two panels -- and it is the one formal
element that distinguishes comics from a series of illustrations.

**A panel in a strip looks exactly as it does alone.** Two things make that true, and
both used to be missing:

- **Each panel is clipped to its frame.** A shot crops the body at the frame, so most of
  a figure usually lies outside it. A panel on its own hides that behind its `viewBox`;
  here the same rectangle is a `clipPath`, or the rest of the figure would draw into the
  gutter -- and, once panels stack, into the tier below. The clip sits on an inner group
  with no transform of its own, because `userSpaceOnUse` is defined against the
  referencing element's user space, which is ambiguous on an element that also carries a
  `transform`. The overlay is clipped too: alone, its `viewBox` clips it just the same.
- **Every id is unique.** Each panel's ids, and the references to them, are prefixed by
  the panel's *position* -- `p1-`, `p2-` -- rather than its name. A name is whatever the
  document said, and while attribute escaping keeps one inside its quotes, nothing would
  keep it inside `url(#...)`. Position is unique, safe and the same on every run. The
  panel's group keeps its name, as `panel-<name>`.
