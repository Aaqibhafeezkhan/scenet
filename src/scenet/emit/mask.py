"""A panel's regions as an instance mask, for region-conditioned image models (#72).

One flat fill per actor, figure and mass, under the id the panel's SVG gives it -- `actor-alice`,
`mass-m0`, `figure-ana` -- so a segmentation keeps the labels the panel has. The colour of an id
is read from the SVG itself. Regions are drawn in the panel's own painter's order, so what covers
what is what the panel draws, and black is nothing.

**A character keeps its colour across panels**, unless another character in the same panel has
the same hue, in which case the later id (in sorted order) takes the next free one. The hue comes
from the id's digest, one of 64, so a regional prompt or an identity follows a character down the
page; a figure a picture draws takes the colour of the part it plays. With 64 hues, two of four
characters share one about one panel in ten. Masses take theirs in drawing order from a band of
their own -- paler, less saturated -- so a wall is never mistaken for a character.

This is an instance map, not a class map: two actors are two colours. What each region is --
an actor's puppet, a mass's kind and plane -- is in the semantics export, by the same id.
