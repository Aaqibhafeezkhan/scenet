Mechanical, like every emitter: the frames were resolved into Page Core and each panel into
its own Panel Core, so this only places one inside the other. Each panel is placed exactly
as the strip places one (:func:`placed_panel <scenet.emit.strip.placed_panel>`): rendered on
its own, clipped to its frame, its ids prefixed by its position so they stay unique in the
page.
