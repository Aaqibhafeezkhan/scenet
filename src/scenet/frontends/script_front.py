"""A frontend for comic script, the format writers already use.

Checked before building this: Fountain has no native panel, caption or SFX support,
and there is no standardised comic script format at all. But the informal industry
convention is stable across publishers -- `PANEL 1`, a prose description, a character
cue in capitals, the dialogue beneath it -- so that is what this parses.

**The honest limitation.** A prose description like "Alice and Bob face each other on
a rainy street corner" cannot be compiled. Turning that into staging needs natural
language understanding, and guessing would produce panels that are confidently wrong
-- far worse than refusing. So descriptions are preserved but not interpreted, and
anything the compiler must know is declared explicitly: cast and staging in a
front-matter block, per-panel settings as `@` directives.

    ---
    cast:
      ALICE: {reference: alice, at: left_third}
      BOB:   {reference: bob,   at: right_third}
    staging:
      - ALICE left_of BOB
    ---

    PANEL 1
    @shot: full_shot
    CAPTION: Midnight. The docks.
    Alice and Bob face each other on a rainy street corner.

    ALICE
    You forgot your umbrella!

    BOB (whisper)
    I know.

    r"""A script as it is read, whatever the editor that saved it did.

    - **Line endings become line feeds.** Python's text mode does this silently when
      reading a file, which is why it took a browser to notice: the playground hands over
      the bytes it was given, and a script saved by a Windows editor -- or pasted from one
      -- arrives with CRLF. The front-matter pattern then does not match, the `---` fence
      is read as prose, and the whole document is rejected for having content before the
      first PANEL heading.
    - **A byte-order mark is dropped.** Some Windows editors still write one, and it hid
      the front matter in exactly the same way.
    - **Text is composed (NFC).** A macOS editor may store `É` as `E` and a combining
      accent, and a name typed that way in a cue is the same name the front matter
      composed; compared as stored, the cue named nobody.

    Example:
        >>> normalise_text("\ufeffZOE\u0308\r\n") == "ZO\u00cb\n"
