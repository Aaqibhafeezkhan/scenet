"""Reading YAML without losing a key written twice.

The YAML specification requires every key in a mapping to be unique, so a document that
repeats one is not valid YAML. PyYAML builds it anyway: the dictionary keeps the **last**
value, and the first disappears without a word. Upstream has long been asked to refuse
(yaml/pyyaml#41, still open).

For Scenet that is exactly the failure the rest of the validation exists to prevent. A
strict language that rejects every unknown key would otherwise lose a whole known one --
a panel, a character, a pose -- and compile whatever was left. So every panel, scene,
script front matter and puppet is read through :func:`load`, a `SafeLoader` that refuses
a repeated key. `ruamel.yaml` refuses by default, but a second YAML implementation in the
runtime, and in the licence gate, would buy this one check; the same trade was declined
for source positions (`frontends/positions.py`).

Two subtleties:

- **A merge key is not a repeat.** `<<: *base` followed by the key again is how YAML
  spells an override, and PyYAML copies the merged keys into the mapping before building
  it. The check looks at the keys as written, before that copy.
- **Keys are compared as loaded.** `1`, `1.0` and `true` are three keys in the text and one
  in the result, so they count as a repeat: one of them would be lost all the same.
