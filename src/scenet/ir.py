    Attributes:
        verb: Always `sfx`, written as `- sfx: {...}`.
        text: The sound, lettered exactly as written. No exclamation mark is added --
            Comicraft's glossary: sound effects are not exclamations -- and an underscore
            is not emphasis here, just an underscore.
        source: Written `from:`. The actor the sound comes from; the effect is placed near
            them. Must be in the cast.
        prefer: Where it would like to sit, for an effect with no source -- or as a pull
            on one that has.
        size: How loud: `small`, `medium` or `large`.
        rotate: Degrees, clockwise, -45 to 45. Comics angle their sound effects; the
            default is level, and the angle is the author's to choose.
        arc: Degrees the line of letters bends through, -120 to 120. Positive bows the
            middle up, negative bows it down.
        hollow: Outline only, no fill, so the art shows through the letters -- what
            letterers call an open effect.

    **Placed by candidates and cost, never at a coordinate.** It never covers a face,
    and balloons pay to cover it, as they pay to cover emanata. It takes its number in
