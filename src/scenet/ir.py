    **Colour is a twin of value, never a replacement.** A tinted colour has the OKLab

    rain is inked or papered, how a caption is lettered -- is made on the grey. Panel Core
    keeps the grey where it always did and adds the colour beside it.

    Only the ladder is tinted: the masses of a setting, the veil and the falling rain.
    Snow, the paper, the figures and all lettering stay as they are in every palette.

    The book is tongue-in-cheek, but the terms entered real use, and they are comics'
    own names for comics' own conventions. So the set is closed and citable, and nothing
    in it is invented here.

    +-------------+---------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+

    "Emanata" is Walker's general term for these, which is why it names the module that
    draws them and the Core field that holds them.

    A mark is not an expression. A character can be angry *and* sweating, so marks are
    a list that composes with `expression:` rather than a second one. Grawlixes are
    drawn as symbols -- a jarn (spiral), a nittle (bursting star), a bolt and a hash --
    rather than typed: an oath written as `@#$%!` already works, as dialogue.

    All four are drawn **outside** the head circle, in the space balloons are placed
    in. They never move a character. A balloon prefers not to cover them, and covers
    them anyway rather than fail when a panel is too crowded to oblige.

    clear day the atmosphere is `#eeeeee` and a white box on it is 1.16:1 -- legible,
    and invisible. The failing case is the pale end, not the dark one.

    +---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+-------------+

    **Drawn from the ladder in `solve/backdrop.py`, not from a second palette.** Three of
    the four are rungs of it, taken by index rather than restated, which is what keeps
    lettering and backdrop from drifting apart as either is tuned. The `day` row is the
    ladder at its widest, so tones taken from it span the most ground.

    **A tone is fixed, not a function of the panel's hour.** A caption's value is a
    property of the caption; letting it drift with `time` would make the contrast table
    a function of the panel and the legibility floor unenforceable.

    `ink` produces what letterers call reversed type: the lettering inverts to paper,
    because black type on a near-black box is not lettering, it is a filled rectangle.
    Which mark reads is resolved by the solver -- see
    :attr:`CoreCaption.ink <scenet.core.CoreCaption>` -- exactly as falling rain's is.

    `warm` is the classic yellow `locale` caption, under the colour policy: its
    value is the grey above, and in a palette with colour it is drawn in that grey's twin,
    a pale yellow of the same lightness. In `mono` it is the grey, which is what a
    black-and-white reprint does to a yellow caption. The other three are neutral in every
    palette.

    There is no free-form colour here. A `fill:` taking any string would be the language's
    one open vocabulary, and would let an author produce an unreadable box.

    "amorphous background regions" as opposed to *things* with a well-defined shape.
    Its own argument is that stuff classes explain scene type and the geometric
    properties of a scene, which is exactly the job here. Taken from an existing
    vocabulary for the same reason the predicates were taken from Visual Genome.

    **Deliberately not the leaf names.** COCO-Stuff's actual classes are
    `building-other`, `sky-other`, `wall-brick`, `water-other` and so on, where the
    `-other` suffix marks the catch-all inside a supercategory. `building-other` is not
    a word anyone should have to type.

    Seven are outdoor -- `building`, `ground`, `plant`, `sky`, `solid`, `structural`,
    `water` -- and five indoor: `ceiling`, `floor`, `furniture`, `wall`, `window`.
    COCO-Stuff's own indoor/outdoor split is where that distinction comes from, so it
