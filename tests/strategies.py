"""Hypothesis strategies that write Scenet documents.

Pydantic v2 dropped its Hypothesis plugin, and `st.builds(PanelIR)` would be no use
anyway: the model validators -- every id resolves, no ordering cycle, the margin leaves
room -- reject nearly everything it drew. So these are hand-written builders that produce
the document an author would write, as a dict, valid by construction. Black's fuzzer
works the same way: it generates valid input rather than deriving it from a model.

**The vocabulary comes from the code, never a copy of it**: the enums, the poses and
expressions of the shipped puppets, the named places, and the characters the shipped
fonts can draw. A new shot type or a new expression is drawn the day it lands.

Each strategy returns a :class:`Drawn`, which keeps the authored document beside its
YAML text, so a test can derive what it expects -- the margin, say -- from what was
written rather than from what the compiler made of it.
