"""Reading YAML without losing a repeated key (#83).

PyYAML keeps the last of two equal keys in a mapping and drops the first without a
word, although the YAML specification makes a repeated key an error. Upstream has long
been asked not to (yaml/pyyaml#41, still open). For a language that rejects every unknown key,
silently losing a known one -- a whole panel, a cast member -- is the worst failure.
