"""What every compiled panel must satisfy, whatever the input.

A solver has an enormous space of outputs and no obvious "correct" coordinate to assert
against, so what can be checked is that certain things are *never* true. These are those
things, in one place: the hand-written panels in `test_pipeline.py` and the generated
ones in `properties/` call the same functions, so the two can never disagree about what
a correct panel is.

Each check raises `AssertionError` naming the box at fault.
