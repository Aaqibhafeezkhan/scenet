    Each tier was tested in isolation -- `PuppetSpec.pose_angles` raising on a bad
    name, `PanelIR` rejecting a bad shot -- and #22 lived in the gap between them:
    every tier was individually correct and the seam was not checked at all. This
    asserts the seam directly, over a corpus, so a future lookup that skips cast
    resolution is caught here rather than needing its own issue filed against it.

    Compared with `--deep`: only `deep=True` promises full agreement. `layout` and
    `balloon-placement` only surface once the solver runs, so the default (cheap)
    check is deliberately allowed to call a document clean that `build` then rejects
    for one of those two reasons -- `cast_less` in the corpus below is exactly that
    case, and its own test lives in `TestDeepChecking`.
