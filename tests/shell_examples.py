"""Run the `bash` examples in the documentation, the `scenet` lines of them.

`docs/reference/cli.md` is the specification, and an example in it that stopped working
would misinform a reader without failing anything. So every documented `scenet build`,
`check`, `schema` and `--version` line is run, in-process through
:func:`scenet.cli.main`, inside a temporary copy of `examples/`, and must exit 0 without
a traceback.

- `scenet mcp` lines are parsed and not run: a server runs until its client leaves.
- A `scenet build --watch` line runs its first build, which must succeed, and then stops
  watching at once: watching runs until the reader presses Ctrl-C.
- `pip`, `pipx`, `uv`, `uvx`, `git`, `gh`, `cp`, `claude`, `wsl` and `ulimit` lines never
  run. They install, publish, reach the network or set limits on the reader's shell, and are
  about the reader's machine, not Scenet.
- A heredoc's body is skipped with its command.

A block that needs a file the reader creates along the way -- the tutorial's
`hello.panel.yaml` -- is marked `<!--- skip: next -->` in the Markdown.
