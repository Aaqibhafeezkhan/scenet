"""Hypothesis profiles for the property tests.

A property failure has to replay identically, on a laptop and in CI alike, so the
default profile is **derandomized everywhere**: Hypothesis seeds each test from a hash
of its own source, and every run tries the same examples. Exploring with fresh seeds is
opt-in, and runs weekly rather than on every pull request.

Choose a profile with `HYPOTHESIS_PROFILE`:

- `fixed`, the default: derandomized, 20 examples, no deadline and no database.
- `ci`: the same as `fixed`. Registered under this name because Hypothesis loads a
  built-in `ci` profile of its own whenever `CI` is set, and that one runs 100 examples,
  which is too many for a compiler at around 50 ms a panel.
- `explore`: random seeds, 300 examples, and a database that remembers what failed.

A failure found under `explore` is pinned as an `@example(...)` on the test, so the
fixed run covers it from then on. `docs/maintainer/testing.md` has the details.
