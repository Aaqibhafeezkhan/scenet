"""The words a panel is read in: its description, and each line of its lettering.

Built in the pipeline and carried in Panel Core, so the emitter copies them and decides
nothing. A description is the author's when there is one -- written, or a comic script's
prose -- and otherwise generated from what the panel holds, covering what AccessComics
found blind readers wanted: the shot, the place and the hour, who is where, facing whom,
with what face and what marks. Generated text is templated English, and deterministic.
