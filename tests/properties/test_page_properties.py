"""Properties of pages, strips and comic scripts, checked against generated ones.

A page is where most recent layout bugs lived: panels read out of order, a strip that
repeated its ids, panel numbers that started again on each page of a script and quietly
replaced the panels before them. Each was an input nobody had written. These properties
write them by the hundred.
