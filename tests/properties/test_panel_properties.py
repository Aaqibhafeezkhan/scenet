"""Properties every single-panel compile must have, checked against generated panels.

The invariants in `tests/invariants.py` were checked against five hand-written panels.
Here they are checked against every panel `tests.strategies.panels` can draw, along with
the four kinds of property that have found real bugs in numerical code: determinism,
invariants, round trips and an oracle (*Falsify your Software*, SciPy 2020).

The profile in `tests/conftest.py` fixes the examples, so a failure replays exactly:
re-run the test and the same panel comes back.
