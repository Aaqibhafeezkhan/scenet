"""Panel Core records the staging an export needs: joints, feature points, the camera (#72).

Each of these was solved before and thrown away: joints and feature points lived only on the
posed puppets, the camera only on `CompileResult`, who looks at whom only in the IR, and the
place and the hour only as tones. An emitter reads Core and nothing else, so each is recorded
-- and each is left out of the JSON when unused, so a Core written before them reads and writes
back byte for byte, and `format_version` stays 1.
