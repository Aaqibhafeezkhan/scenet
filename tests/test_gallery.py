"""Every example the playground offers must actually compile.

The playground's gallery is not a list of strings inside a TypeScript file. It is these
files, compiled here, and served to the browser at build time. So an example that stops
working fails the build rather than greeting the first visitor with a stack trace.

That also makes the gallery a coverage instrument in its own right: between them these
files exercise every shot type, every camera angle, every balloon kind, every placement
zone, every predicate and both frontends. A construct that no example uses is a
construct nobody has looked at.
