# Compose a page

A comic is designed a page at a time: how many tiers, which panel gets the width, where
the page turns. A scene can say that. Its panels stay exactly as you write them, and
`pages:` lays them out.

## Tiers, by weight

```yaml
page: {size: [1500, 2250], margin: 75, gutter: 30, tier_gutter: 45}

pages:
  - tiers:
      - panels: [{use: establishing, width: 2}, reply]
      - {height: 1.2, panels: [closer]}
      - panels: [her, him]

panels:
  establishing: {...}
  reply: {...}
  closer: {...}
  her: {...}
  him: {...}
```

A page is a list of tiers, top to bottom; a tier is a list of panels, in reading order. Write a
panel by its name, or as `{use: name, width: 2}` to give it a bigger share. A tier's
`height` is its share of the page the same way. The margin and the gutters come off first,
and what is left is shared out by weight, the way CSS Grid shares a row between `fr` tracks.

The order you write panels in is the order they are read in: tier by tier, left to right.
That is the reading path readers follow on a grid, so a page built from tiers cannot be read
in the wrong order.

## A page read right to left

A manga is read from the top right. Say so once, beside `panels:`, and write the page exactly as
before, in reading order:

```yaml
direction: rtl
pages:
  - tiers:
      - panels: [{use: arrival, width: 2}, door]
      - panels: [phone, wait]
```

`arrival` now takes the right two thirds of the first tier and `door` the left third; `phone` is
bottom right. Columns go the same way, and each column is still read top to bottom. Nothing in a
panel is mirrored: every panel is compiled at the size it had, its figures stand where their `at:`
puts them, an inset sits in the corner its `at:` names, and a slanted gutter leans the way its
`slant` says. Only the lettering in each panel follows the direction too, read from the top right.
The gallery's *Read right to left* page and its left-to-right twin show the difference side by side.

## A tall panel beside a stack

```yaml
pages:
  - tiers:
      - panels: [arrival]
      - height: 2
        columns:
          - {width: 2, panels: [look_up, {use: horror, height: 2}]}
          - {width: 1, panels: [the_fall]}
```

A tier can hold `columns:` in place of `panels:`. The tier is split across into columns by
their `width`, and each column down into its panels by their `height`, with the tier gutter
between them. A column of one panel spans the tier's whole height.

Columns are read one after another, top to bottom in each: `look_up`, `horror`, `the_fall`.
That is what readers do when a tall panel stands beside a stack. It blocks the way across, and
about nine readers in ten go down the stack first. Two stacks side by side have nothing
blocking the way, so readers go across them, and `scenet check` refuses them; write them as
tiers instead.

`examples/gallery/25-columns.scene.yaml` is a page built this way.

## An inset

```yaml
pages:
  - tiers:
      - height: 2
        panels:
          - use: street
            insets:
              - {use: clock, at: top_left, size: 0.22, read: before}
              - {use: worry, at: bottom_right, size: 0.35}
      - panels: [arrive, shrug]
```

Any panel in a tier or a column can carry `insets:`, small panels set into its corners. `at`
names the corner, and `size` is the inset's width and height as a fraction of its parent's, at
most a half. An inset sits a gutter in from both edges of its corner, with a ring of white a
gutter wide around it, and is drawn over its parent.

**Say when it is read.** Readers split about evenly over whether an inset comes before the panel
it sits in or after it, so Scenet does not guess. An inset is read right after its parent; write
`read: before` for one that sets the scene, like the clock here.

**The parent's art does not move.** The figures and the setting are drawn as if the inset were
not there, and only the parent's lettering moves out from under it. So choose a corner that
covers nothing that matters: when an inset covers a face, the compiler says so in its notes.

`examples/gallery/26-insets.scene.yaml` is the page above in full.

## A slanted tier

```yaml
pages:
  - tiers:
      - panels: [standoff]
      - {height: 1.2, slant: 12, panels: [wind_up, {use: swing, width: 1.3}]}
      - {slant: -8, panels: [miss, {use: splash, width: 1.4}, look]}
```

`slant` leans every gutter in a tier of panels, by up to 30 degrees either way: positive leans the
top to the right. The weights share the width out exactly as they would upright, measured at the
tier's mid-height, and a gutter stays a gutter wide across the cut. Lean a fight, a fall or a
shock; leave a conversation square.

A slanted panel is framed in its bounding box and cropped to its outline, so a figure near the
cut loses what falls outside it, as it would at a margin. Keep faces clear of the cut: a close-up
in a narrow slanted panel is the usual way to lose one, and the compiler says when it happens.

`examples/gallery/27-slant.scene.yaml` is the page above in full.

`examples/gallery/24-page.scene.yaml` is a whole page, and the playground offers it as
"A page: panels in tiers".

A comic script lays out its pages too: each `PAGE` heading is a page, its panels in tiers
by a fixed rule or by `@tiers:`. See
[Write a panel as a comic script](write_a_comic_script.md#pages).

## What the page decides, and what it does not

```python
from scenet import compile_book

book = compile_book("""
cast: {alice: {reference: alice}}
page: {size: [1200, 1800], margin: 60, gutter: 30, tier_gutter: 40}
pages:
  - tiers:
      - panels: [wide, {use: tall, width: 2}]
      - {height: 3, panels: [last]}
panels:
  wide: {script: [{say: {by: alice, text: "Hello."}}]}
  tall: {over: wide}
  last: {over: wide, camera: {shot: close_up}}
""")

# Each panel is compiled at the size of its frame...
(page,) = book.pages
assert [(frame.panel, frame.width, frame.height) for frame in page.frames] == [
    ("wide", 350.0, 410.0),
    ("tall", 700.0, 410.0),
    ("last", 1080.0, 1230.0),
]
assert (book.panels["tall"].core.width, book.panels["tall"].core.height) == (700.0, 410.0)

# ...and every panel on the page letters at one size, whatever its height.
wide = book.panels["wide"].core.balloons[0].font_size
last = book.panels["last"].core.balloons[0].font_size
assert wide == last
```

The page decides two things about a panel: the size of its frame, and its type size. Nothing
else. A panel on a page is exactly that panel compiled on its own at that size, so it never
changes because of what sits beside it.

Type size is the one deliberate exception to "a panel letters at a fixed fraction of its own
height". On a page, every panel takes its type size from the same height, as if each were one
tier of a three-tier page. A short wide panel and a tall one then letter alike, as a letterer
would set them.

## Building it

<!--- skip: next -->

```bash
scenet build story.scene.yaml --core
```

writes each panel, as before, and each page beside them:

```
story.wide.svg  story.tall.svg  story.last.svg
story.page-1.svg               the page, every panel at its frame
story.page-1.core.json         where each frame is (with --core)
```

A panel named `page-1` would be written to the same file as the first page. Rather than one
replacing the other, `scenet build` stops and asks you to rename the panel.

## Mistakes it catches

`scenet check` reports these as `page-layout`, on the line at fault:

- a tier that places a panel `panels:` does not define;
- a panel placed twice, on one page or two;
- a tier with both `panels:` and `columns:`, or with neither;
- two stacks side by side, which readers would read across rather than down;
- two insets in one panel that come within a gutter of each other;
- a slant on a tier of columns, on a tier of one panel, or on panels with insets, or one so
  steep that a panel would have no width left at its top or bottom;
- a margin and gutters that leave no room for the panels;
- `pages:` in a document that has no `panels:` to lay out.

A panel that is on no page is not a mistake: it compiles as it always did, and may exist only
to be inherited from with `over:`.
