# Panel Core

The resolved intermediate format, between the authored source and emitted SVG.

```
*.panel.yaml   →   IR   →   *.core.json   →   *.svg
authored           validated   resolved         rendered
```

## Why this tier exists

Vega-Lite compiles a high-level grammar into a lower-level one before emitting SVG, rather than
going straight to pixels. The same split pays for itself here, in four ways:

1. **Tests target stable numbers, not markup.** Golden-file tests compare Panel Core JSON, which
   changes only when layout genuinely changes. Diffing SVG text is brittle: reordered attributes or
   a changed path-rounding convention produce enormous diffs that mean nothing.
2. **Layouts can be adjusted by hand.** An artist who wants one balloon two millimetres left can
   edit the Core file, without touching the source or re-running the solver.
3. **One input, several emitters.** SVG, the debug overlay, and later formats all consume the same
   resolved tier.
4. **The high-level grammar stays a strict subset of the low-level one**, so nothing expressible in
   the source is inexpressible after resolution.

## Properties

- **Fully numeric.** Every position, size and scale is an absolute number in panel units. No
  `left_third`, no `medium_shot` — those are resolved away.
- **Still named.** Actors, balloons, captions and anchors keep their source identifiers, so a Core
  file is readable and diffable. This is what separates it from SVG.
- **Deterministic.** Floats are rounded to a fixed precision on emission, so identical input yields
  byte-identical Core output on any platform.

`lines` is the *resolved* line breaking, not the source string. Wrapping is decided during
compilation using real font metrics, so the emitter never re-measures and never disagrees with the
solver about how wide a balloon needs to be. For a `spoken` caption the quotation marks are part of
those lines for the same reason: marks added afterwards would not fit the box drawn for them.

A line with [emphasis](language.md#emphasis) in it is still plain text in `lines`, the text as it
reads. Beside `lines`, the balloon or caption then carries `runs`: every line cut wherever its face
changes, so the emitter draws each run in the face it was measured in. The runs of a line must
spell it exactly, and a Core whose runs do not is refused.

```json
"lines": ["I told you it", "would rain."],
"runs": [
  [{ "text": "I ", "face": "regular" }, { "text": "told", "face": "bold_italic" }, { "text": " you it", "face": "regular" }],
  [{ "text": "would rain.", "face": "regular" }]
]
```

`face` is `regular`, `italic` or `bold_italic`. A balloon or caption with no emphasis has no
`runs` key at all, so every Core written before emphasis existed reads, and is written, byte for
byte as before — which is why it needed no `format_version` bump.

`italic` is recorded rather than re-derived from `kind`, so the emitter cannot draw a box in a face
the solver did not measure it in. `fill` and `ink` are there for the same reason: a caption's tone
resolves to a value here, and the ink is chosen against it by contrast — so a dark box arrives at the
emitter already lettered in paper, and the emitter is left with no decision about which mark reads.
Both are defaulted to the white and near-black every caption had before tones existed, which is why
adding them needed no `format_version` bump either.

**`order` is one sequence across both lists.** Balloons and captions are placed in a single pass in
script order, so a caption between two lines of dialogue takes the number between theirs and a
balloon list can have gaps in it. A panel with no captions is unaffected, which is why this did not
need a `format_version` bump.

`backdrop` is absent on a panel that says nothing about where it is, which is why adding it did not
need a bump either. Its masses carry **fully resolved numeric polygons and tone values**, the same
discipline as `capsules`, `blobs` and `face_marks`: the emitter is left with no layout decision, and
a backdrop can be read, diffed and hand-adjusted like everything else in this tier. `depth` is the
same painter's order the actors use, so masses and figures sort into one sequence.

An actor with `marks` carries three more fields. `marks` names what was asked for; `emanata` is the
drawing, in the same `stroke` and `disc` primitives as `face_marks`, with ids numbered per mark
(`plewd_0`, `plewd_1`, ...); and `emanata_zones` holds one polygon per mark, which is what balloon and
caption placement paid to avoid. The zones are recorded so a Core document says why a balloon is
where it is. All three default to empty, so an actor without marks serialises with `[]` in each and
nothing else changes — which is why they needed no `format_version` bump either.

```json
"marks": ["plewds"],
"emanata": [{ "mark": "stroke", "id": "plewd_0", "points": [[171.2, 98.6], "..."], "width": 5.9, "closed": true }],
"emanata_zones": [[[150.3, 61.0], [205.8, 70.4], "..."]]
```

`seed` is kept so that a Core document explains itself: two panels with the same masses and
different skylines differ here, and here is where to look.

### Determinism is on this text, and on the SVG text — not on pixels

The atmosphere's `veil` is a set of `feTurbulence` parameters rather than an image, and the filter
is reproducible by specification. What browsers paint from it agrees only approximately. See
[the language reference](language.md#the-contract-is-on-the-svg-text-not-on-pixels), where the
boundary is stated in full; golden-file tests target this tier and the SVG text, never a raster.

## Page Core

A scene with `pages:` gets one more document per page, alongside each panel's Panel Core. It holds
where each panel's frame is, and nothing drawn:

```json
{
  "format_version": 1,
  "width": 1500.0,
  "height": 2250.0,
  "lettering_height": 700.0,
  "frames": [
    { "panel": "establishing", "x": 75.0, "y": 75.0, "width": 880.0, "height": 628.12 },
    { "panel": "reply", "x": 985.0, "y": 75.0, "width": 440.0, "height": 628.12 }
  ]
}
```

`frames` are in reading order: tier by tier, left to right, and down each column of a tier of
columns, with an inset right after the panel it is set into or, for `read: before`, right before
it. An inset's frame also carries `inset_of`, the panel it sits in, and `clearance`, the area it
covers with its ring of white; the page paints that white under it. Neither field is written for
a panel that is no inset.

The parent's own Core then carries `exclusions`: each inset's clearance, moved into the parent's
coordinates, which no balloon or caption was allowed to touch. Nothing else in the parent moved
for it, so the art under an inset is exactly the art of the panel compiled alone. A panel with no
inset has no `exclusions` key at all, so every Core written before insets existed reads, and is
written, byte for byte as before.

A panel in a slanted tier carries `outline`, its four corners clockwise from the top left, on its
frame in page units and in its own Core in panel units; the frame is the outline's bounding box.
The panel is drawn clipped to it, and bordered by it. A rectangle has no `outline` key. Each panel's own Core was compiled at
exactly its frame's `width` and `height`, so a panel's Core reads the same on a page as it would
alone at that size, and a page adds no layout decision to a panel.

`lettering_height` is the one thing every panel on the page shares: the height their type sizes are
a fraction of, in place of each panel's own. It is recorded so that a Page Core says why two panels
of different heights letter at the same size.

`scenet build --core` writes it as `stem.page-<n>.core.json`; `compile_book` returns it as
`Book.pages`.
